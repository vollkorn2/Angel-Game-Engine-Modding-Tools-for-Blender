Modding Tools to run inside of Blender for Games developed with Angel Game Engine:
Angel Game Engine made by Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego)

Each Tool has its own ReadMe.
Open the Tools in Text Editor inside of Blender.
You need to set up needed Variables on Top of each Script.

Tools Included:
Mod2Blender:  Imports 3D Models (.mod/.xmod) to Blender / Note: not as far developed as Dummiesman AngelStudiosBlenderAddon
ToDo:         Compare to Dummiesman and Overhaul or Delete this Script depending on what makes more sense

Tex2Png:      Converts all Textures (.tex/.xtex) to PNG / Note: Games like Spy Hunter or Transworld Surf are NOT tested and could have TexTypes that are not Supported by Tex2Png
ToDo:         Write Text File (.txt) to Export Flags and Garbage needed for Png2Tex and for analysing
              Compare Flags and Garbage

Png2Tex:      Converts all PNGs to Textures (.tex/.xtex) / Note: Experimental! Only Red Dead Revolver is Tested and Loading Levels don't work at all!
ToDo:         Read Text File (.txt) to Import Flags and Garbage from Tex2Png (Possibly fixes Game crash for Modded Textures)
              Test out different Flags and Garbage
